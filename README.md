# COI - Cookie Consent Opt-In

COI is a simple cookie and consent manager that helps you to be transparent
about the third-party applications on your website.  It is designed to be
extremely simple, intuitive and easy to use while allowing you to be 
compliant with all relevant regulations (notably GDPR and ePrivacy).

COI is a fork of "[Klaro!](https://github.com/KIProtect/klaro)", a great,
free and open consent manager.

**NOTE:** it's Work in Progress, not yet released.
